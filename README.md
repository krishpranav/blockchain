# Blockchain Implementation in Every Programming Language

This repository contains a full-fledged blockchain implementation in **every programming language** available. Each implementation includes fundamental blockchain features such as:

- Block structure with index, hash, previous hash, timestamp, and transactions
- Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm
- Blockchain validation
- Simple transaction handling
